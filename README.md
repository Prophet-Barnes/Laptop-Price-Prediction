# Laptop-Price-Prediction
The project deals with performing EDA on the dataset for purchased laptops and creating a regression model to predict the prices of laptops.

The dataset used comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/what-determines-price-of-a-laptop/data.

Since the dataset was not UTF-8 encoded, it was first converted to the same before using it in our model.
